<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing
<em>reusable</em> object-oriented software is even harder.  You
must find pertinent objects, factor them into classes at the right
granularity, define class interfaces and inheritance hierarchies,
and establish key relationships among them.  Your design should be
specific to the problem at hand but also general enough to address
future problems and requirements.  You also want to avoid redesign,
or at least minimize it.  Experienced object-oriented designers
will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult if
not impossible to get "right" the first time.  Before a design is
finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it
each time.</p>
<p>Yet experienced object-oriented designers do make good designs.
Meanwhile new designers are overwhelmed by the options available and
tend to fall back on non-object-oriented techniques they've used
before.  It takes a long time for novices to learn what good
object-oriented design is all about.  Experienced designers evidently
know something inexperienced ones don't.  What is it?</p>
<p>One thing expert designers know <em>not</em> to do is solve every problem
from first principles.  Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked
for them in the past.  When they find a good solution, they use it
again and again.  Such experience is part of what makes them experts.
Consequently, you'll find recurring patterns of classes and
communicating objects in many object-oriented systems.  These patterns
solve specific design problems and make object-oriented designs more
flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable.  They help designers reuse
successful designs by basing new designs on prior experience. A
designer who is familiar with such patterns can apply them immediately
to design problems without having to rediscover them.</p>
<p>An analogy will help illustrate the point.  Novelists and playwrights
rarely design their plots from scratch.  Instead, they follow patterns
like "Tragically Flawed Hero" (Macbeth, Hamlet, etc.) or "The
Romantic Novel" (countless romance novels).  In the same way,
object-oriented designers follow patterns like "represent states with
objects" and "decorate objects so you can easily add/remove
features." Once you know the pattern, a lot of design decisions
follow automatically.</p>
<p>We all know the value of design experience.  How many times have you
had design <em>d&#233;j&#224;-vu</em>&#151;that feeling that you've solved a
problem before but not knowing exactly where or how?  If you could
remember the details of the previous problem and how you solved it,
then you could reuse the experience instead of rediscovering it.
However, we don't do a good job of recording experience in
software design for others to use.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to record experience in designing
object-oriented software as design patterns.  Each design
pattern systematically names, explains, and evaluates an important and
recurring design in object-oriented systems.  Our goal is to capture
design experience in a form that people can use effectively.  To this
end we have documented some of the most important design patterns and
present them as a catalog.</p>
<p>Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and
architectures. Expressing proven techniques as design patterns makes
them more accessible to developers of new systems. Design patterns
help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and
avoid alternatives that compromise reusability. Design patterns can
even improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by
furnishing an explicit specification of class and object interactions
and their underlying intent. Put simply, design patterns help a
designer get a design "right" faster.</p>
<p>None of the design patterns in this book describes new or unproven
designs.  We have included only designs that have been applied more
than once in different systems.  Most of these designs have never been
documented before.  They are either part of the folklore of the
object-oriented community or are elements of some successful
object-oriented systems&#151;neither of which is easy for novice
designers to learn from.  So although these designs aren't new, we
capture them in a new and accessible way: as a catalog of design
patterns having a consistent format.</p>
<p>Despite the book's size, the design patterns in it capture only a
fraction of what an expert might know.  It doesn't have any patterns
dealing with concurrency or distributed programming or real-time
programming.  It doesn't have any application domain-specific
patterns.  It doesn't tell you how to build user interfaces, how to
write device drivers, or how to use an object-oriented database.  Each
of these areas has its own patterns, and it would be worthwhile for
someone to catalog those too.</p>
<h3>
What is a Design Pattern?</h3>
<p>Christopher Alexander says, "Each pattern describes a problem
which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way
that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
doing it the same way twice" [AIS+77, <em>x</em>].  Even
though Alexander was talking about patterns in buildings and towns,
what he says is true about object-oriented design patterns.  Our
solutions are expressed in terms of objects and interfaces instead
of walls and doors, but at the core of both kinds of patterns is
a solution to a problem in a context.</p>
<p>In general, a pattern has four essential elements:</p><ol>
<li>The <strong>pattern name</strong>
is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions,
and consequences in a word or two.  Naming a pattern immediately
increases our design vocabulary.  It lets us design at a higher level
of abstraction.  Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us talk about
them with our colleagues, in our documentation, and even to ourselves.
It makes it easier to think about designs and to communicate them and
their trade-offs to others.  Finding good names has been one of the
hardest parts of developing our catalog.</li>



<li>The <strong>problem</strong>
describes when to apply the pattern.  It explains the problem and its
context.  It might describe specific design problems such as how to
represent algorithms as objects. It might describe class or object
structures that are symptomatic of an inflexible design.  Sometimes
the problem will include a list of conditions that must be met before
it makes sense to apply the pattern.</li>



<li>The <strong>solution</strong>
describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships,
responsibilities, and collaborations.  The solution doesn't describe a
particular concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is
like a template that can be applied in many different situations.
Instead, the pattern provides an abstract description of a design
problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects
in our case) solves it.</li>



<li>The <strong>consequences</strong>
are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.  Though
consequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions,
they are critical for evaluating design alternatives and for
understanding the costs and benefits of applying the pattern.

The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs.
They may address language and implementation issues as well.  Since
reuse is often a factor in object-oriented design, the consequences of
a pattern include its impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility,
or portability.  Listing these consequences explicitly helps you
understand and evaluate them.</li></ol>
<p>Point of view affects one's interpretation of what is and isn't a
pattern.  One person's pattern can be another person's primitive
building block.  For this book we have concentrated on patterns at a
certain level of abstraction.  <em>Design patterns</em> are not about
designs such as linked lists and hash tables that can be encoded in
classes and reused as is.  Nor are they complex, domain-specific
designs for an entire application or subsystem.  The design patterns
in this book are <em>descriptions of communicating objects and
classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a
particular context</em>.</p>
<p>A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a
common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable
object-oriented design. The design pattern identifies the
participating classes and instances, their roles and collaborations,
and the distribution of responsibilities. Each design pattern focuses
on a particular object-oriented design problem or issue.  It describes
when it applies, whether it can be applied in view of other design
constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of its use.  Since we
must eventually implement our designs, a design pattern also provides
sample C++ and (sometimes) Smalltalk code to illustrate an
implementation.</p>



<p>Although design patterns describe object-oriented designs, they are
based on practical solutions that have been implemented in mainstream
object-oriented programming languages like Smalltalk and C++ rather
than procedural languages (Pascal, C, Ada) or more dynamic
object-oriented languages (CLOS, Dylan, Self).  We chose Smalltalk and
C++ for pragmatic reasons: Our day-to-day experience has been in these
languages, and they are increasingly popular.</p>
<p>The choice of programming language is important because it
influences one's point of view.  Our patterns assume Smalltalk/C++-level
language features, and that choice determines what can and cannot
be implemented easily.  If we assumed procedural languages, we
might have included design patterns called "Inheritance,"
"Encapsulation," and "Polymorphism."  Similarly, some of our patterns
are supported directly by the less common object-oriented languages.
CLOS has multi-methods, for example, which lessen the need for a
pattern such as Visitor.  In fact, there
are enough differences between Smalltalk and C++ to mean that some
patterns can be expressed more easily in one language than the
other.  (See Iterator 
for an example.)</p>
<h3>
Design Patterns in Smalltalk MVC</h3>
<p>The Model/View/Controller (MVC) triad of
classes [KP88] is used to build user interfaces
in Smalltalk-80.  Looking at the design patterns inside MVC should
help you see what we mean by the term "pattern."</p>
<p>MVC consists of three kinds of objects.  The Model is the application
object, the View is its screen presentation, and the Controller
defines the way the user interface reacts to user input.  Before MVC,
user interface designs tended to lump these objects together.  MVC
decouples them to increase flexibility and reuse.</p>
<p>MVC decouples views and models by establishing a subscribe/notify
protocol between them.  A view must ensure that its appearance
reflects the state of the model.  Whenever the model's data changes,
the model notifies views that depend on it.  In response, each view
gets an opportunity to update itself.  This approach lets you attach
multiple views to a model to provide different presentations.  You can
also create new views for a model without rewriting it.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a model and three views.  (We've left out
the controllers for simplicity.)  The model contains some data values,
and the views defining a spreadsheet, histogram, and pie chart display
these data in various ways.  The model communicates with its views when
its values change, and the views communicate with the model to access
these values.</p><p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/mvc.gif"></p>
<p>Taken at face value, this example reflects a design that decouples
views from models.  But the design is applicable to a more general
problem: decoupling objects so that changes to one can affect any
number of others without requiring the changed object to know
details of the others. This more general design is described by
the Observer
design pattern.</p>
<p>Another feature of MVC is that views can be nested.  For example, a
control panel of buttons might be implemented as a complex view
containing nested button views.  The user interface for an object
inspector can consist of nested views that may be reused in a
debugger. MVC supports nested views with the CompositeView class, a
subclass of View. CompositeView objects act just like View objects; a
composite view can be used wherever a view can be used, but it also
contains and manages nested views.</p>
<p>Again, we could think of this as a design that lets us treat a
composite view just like we treat one of its components.  But the
design is applicable to a more general problem, which occurs whenever
we want to group objects and treat the group like an individual
object.  This more general design is described by the
Composite  design pattern. It lets you create a
class hierarchy in which some subclasses define primitive objects
(e.g., Button) and other classes define composite objects
(CompositeView) that assemble the primitives into more complex
objects.</p>
<p>MVC also lets you change the way a view responds to user input without
changing its visual presentation.  You might want to change the way it
responds to the keyboard, for example, or have it use a pop-up menu
instead of command keys.  MVC encapsulates the response mechanism in a
Controller object.  There is a class hierarchy of controllers, making
it easy to create a new controller as a variation on an existing one.</p>
<p>A view uses an instance of a Controller subclass to implement a
particular response strategy; to implement a different strategy,
simply replace the instance with a different kind of controller.  It's
even possible to change a view's controller at run-time to let the
view change the way it responds to user input.  For example, a view
can be disabled so that it doesn't accept input simply by giving it a
controller that ignores input events.</p>
<p>The View-Controller relationship is an example of the
Strategy  design pattern.  A
Strategy is an object that represents an algorithm.  It's useful
when you want to replace the algorithm either statically or
dynamically, when you have a lot of variants of the algorithm, or
when the algorithm has complex data structures that you want to
encapsulate.</p>
<p>MVC uses other design patterns, such as Factory Method  to specify the default controller
class for a view and Decorator 
to add scrolling to a view.  But the main relationships in MVC are
given by the Observer, Composite, and Strategy design patterns.</p>
<h3>
Describing Design Patterns</h3>
<p>How do we describe design patterns?  Graphical notations, while
important and useful, aren't sufficient. They simply capture the end
product of the design process as relationships between classes and
objects. To reuse the design, we must also record the decisions,
alternatives, and trade-offs that led to it.  Concrete examples are
important too, because they help you see the design in action.</p>
<p>We describe design patterns using a consistent format.  Each pattern
is divided into sections according to the following template.  The
template lends a uniform structure to the information, making design
patterns easier to learn, compare, and use.</p><dl><dt><b>Pattern Name and Classification</b>
<dd>The pattern's name conveys the essence of the pattern succinctly.
A good name is vital, because it will become part of your design
vocabulary.  The pattern's classification reflects the

can you recognize these situations?</dd>



<dt><b>Structure</b>
<dd>A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern using a
notation based on the Object Modeling Technique
(OMT) [RBP+91]. We also use
interaction diagrams [JCJO92,

trade-offs and results of using the pattern?  What aspect of
system structure does it let you vary independently?</dd>

understand the patterns and the discussions surrounding them.
Appendix&nbsp;A is a glossary of terminology we
use.  We've already mentioned
Appendix&nbsp;B, which
presents the various notations.  We'll also describe aspects of the
notations as we introduce them in the upcoming discussions.  Finally,
Appendix&nbsp;C contains source code for the
foundation classes we use in code samples.</p><h3>
The Catalog of Design Patterns</h3>
<p>The catalog beginning on 
contains 23 design patterns.  Their names and intents are listed next
to give you an overview.  The number in parentheses after each pattern
name gives the number for the pattern (a convention we follow
throughout the book).</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Abstract Factory </b>
<dd>Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes.



<dt><b>Adapter </b>
<dd>Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.


<dt><b>Bridge </b>
<dd>Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
can vary independently.


<dt><b>Builder </b>
<dd>Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different
representations.


<dt><b>Chain of Responsibility </b>
<dd>Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object
handles it.


<dt><b>Command </b>
<dd>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.


<dt><b>Composite </b>
<dd>Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.



<dt><b>Decorator </b>
<dd>Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
functionality.



<dt><b>Facade </b>
<dd>Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem
easier to use.



<dt><b>Factory Method </b>
<dd>Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.



<dt><b>Flyweight </b>
<dd>Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.


<dt><b>Interpreter </b>
<dd>Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an
interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the
language.


<dt><b>Iterator </b>
<dd>Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.



<dt><b>Mediator </b>
<dd>Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to
each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction
independently.



<dt><b>Memento </b>
<dd>Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's
internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.


<dt><b>Observer </b>
<dd>Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.



<dt><b>Prototype </b>
<dd>Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical
instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.



<dt><b>Proxy </b>
<dd>Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.



<dt><b>Singleton </b>
<dd>Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point
of access to it.



<dt><b>State </b>
<dd>Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
The object will appear to change its class.



<dt><b>Strategy </b>
<dd>Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
interchangeable.  Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.



<dt><b>Template Method </b>
<dd>Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some
steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
structure.



<dt><b>Visitor </b>
<dd>Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
structure.  Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the
classes of the elements on which it operates.</dl>
<h3>
Organizing the Catalog</h3>
<p>Design patterns vary in their granularity and level of abstraction.
Because there are many design patterns, we need a way to organize
them.  This section classifies design patterns so that we can refer to
families of related patterns.  The classification helps you learn the
patterns in the catalog faster, and it can direct efforts to find
new patterns as well.</p>

<p>We classify design patterns by two criteria
(Table 1.1). The first criterion, called
<strong>purpose</strong>, reflects what a pattern does.  Patterns can
have either <strong>creational</strong>, <strong>structural</strong>, or
<strong>behavioral</strong> purpose. Creational patterns concern the
process of object creation.  Structural patterns deal with the
composition of classes or objects.  Behavioral patterns characterize
the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute
responsibility.</p>

</td></table></center><p align=CENTER>Table 1.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Design pattern space</p>
<p>The second criterion, called <strong>scope</strong>, specifies whether the
pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects.  Class patterns
deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses.  These
relationships are established through inheritance, so they are
static&#151;fixed at compile-time.  Object patterns deal with object
relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic.
Almost all patterns use inheritance to some extent.  So the only
patterns labeled "class patterns" are those that focus on class
relationships.  Note that most patterns are in the Object scope.</p>
<p>Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to
subclasses, while Creational object patterns defer it to another
object.  The Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose
classes, while the Structural object patterns describe ways to
assemble objects.  The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to
describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object
patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task
that no single object can carry out alone.</p>
<p>There are other ways to organize the patterns.  Some patterns are
often used together.  For example, Composite is often used with
Iterator or Visitor.  Some patterns are alternatives: Prototype is
often an alternative to Abstract Factory.  Some patterns result in
similar designs even though the patterns have different intents.  For
example, the structure diagrams of Composite and Decorator are
similar.</p>
<p>Yet another way to organize design patterns is according to how they
reference each other in their "Related Patterns" sections.
Figure 1.1 depicts these relationships graphically.</p>
<p>Clearly there are many ways to organize design patterns.  Having
multiple ways of thinking about patterns will deepen your insight into
what they do, how they compare, and when to apply them.</p><a name="intro_overview">

<h3>
How Design Patterns Solve Design Problems</h3>
<p>Design patterns solve many of the day-to-day problems object-oriented
designers face, and in many different ways.  Here are several of these
problems and how design patterns solve them.</p>
<h4>Finding Appropriate Objects</h4>
<p>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An
object packages both data and the procedures that operate
on that data. The procedures are typically called <strong>methods</strong>
or operations. An object performs an operation when it
receives a request (or <strong>message</strong>) from a
<strong>client</strong>.</p>
<p>Requests are the <em>only</em> way to get an object to execute an
operation. Operations are the <em>only</em> way to change an object's
internal data. Because of these restrictions, the object's internal
state is said to be encapsulated; it cannot be accessed
directly, and its representation is invisible from outside the
object.</p>
<p>The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system
into objects.  The task is difficult because many factors come into
play: encapsulation, granularity, dependency, flexibility,
performance, evolution, reusability, and on and on.  They all
influence the decomposition, often in conflicting ways.</p>
<p>Object-oriented design methodologies favor many different approaches.
You can write a problem statement, single out the nouns and verbs, and
create corresponding classes and operations. Or you can focus on the
collaborations and responsibilities in your system.  Or you can model
the real world and translate the objects found during analysis into
design.  There will always be disagreement on which approach is best.</p>
<p>Many objects in a design come from the analysis model.  But
object-oriented designs often end up with classes that have no
counterparts in the real world.  Some of these are low-level
classes like arrays.  Others are much higher-level.  For example, the
Composite  pattern introduces an abstraction for
treating objects uniformly that doesn't have a physical counterpart.
Strict modeling of the real world leads to a system that reflects
today's realities but not necessarily tomorrow's.  The abstractions
that emerge during design are key to making a design flexible.</p>
<p>Design patterns help you identify less-obvious abstractions and the
objects that can capture them.  For example, objects that represent a
process or algorithm don't occur in nature, yet they are a crucial
part of flexible designs. The Strategy  pattern
describes how to implement interchangeable families of algorithms.
The State  pattern represents each state of an entity
as an object.  These objects are seldom found during analysis or even
the early stages of design; they're discovered later in the course of
making a design more flexible and reusable.</p><h4>Determining Object Granularity</h4>
<p>Objects can vary tremendously in size and number.  They can represent
everything down to the hardware or all the way up to entire
applications.  How do we decide what should be an object?</p>
<p>Design patterns address this issue as well.  The
Facade  pattern describes how to represent complete
subsystems as objects, and the Flyweight (195) pattern
describes how to support huge numbers of objects at the finest
granularities.  Other design patterns describe specific ways of
decomposing an object into smaller objects.  Abstract Factory  and Builder 
yield objects whose only responsibilities are creating other objects.
Visitor  and Command  yield
objects whose only responsibilities are to implement a request on
another object or group of objects.</p>
<h4>Specifying Object Interfaces</h4>
<p>Every operation declared by an object specifies the operation's name,
the objects it takes as parameters, and the operation's return value.
This is known as the operation's signature.  The set of
all signatures defined by an object's operations is called the
interface to the object. An object's interface
characterizes the complete set of requests that can be sent to the
object. Any request that matches a signature in the object's interface
may be sent to the object.</p>


<p>A type is a name used to denote a particular interface. We
speak of an object as having the type "Window" if it accepts all
requests for the operations defined in the interface named "Window."
An object may have many types, and widely different objects can share
a type. Part of an object's interface may be characterized by one
type, and other parts by other types. Two objects of the same type
need only share parts of their interfaces.  Interfaces can contain
other interfaces as subsets. We say that a type is a subtype of
another if its interface contains the interface of its
supertype.  Often we speak of a subtype <em>inheriting</em> the
interface of its supertype.</p>
<p>Interfaces are fundamental in object-oriented systems.  Objects are
known only through their interfaces. There is no way to know anything
about an object or to ask it to do anything without going through its
interface.  An object's interface says nothing about its
implementation&#151;different objects are free to implement requests
differently.  That means two objects having completely different
implementations can have identical interfaces.</p>
<p>When a request is sent to an object, the particular operation that's
performed depends on <em>both</em> the request <em>and</em> the receiving
object.  Different objects that support identical requests may have
different implementations of the operations that fulfill these
requests. The run-time association of a request to an object and one
of its operations is known as dynamic binding.</p>
<p>Dynamic binding means that issuing a request doesn't commit you to a
particular implementation until run-time. Consequently, you can write
programs that expect an object with a particular interface, knowing
that any object that has the correct interface will accept the
request.  Moreover, dynamic binding lets you substitute objects that
have identical interfaces for each other at run-time.  This
substitutability is known as polymorphism, and it's a key
concept in object-oriented systems. It lets a client object make few
assumptions about other objects beyond supporting a particular
interface. Polymorphism simplifies the definitions of clients,
decouples objects from each other, and lets them vary their
relationships to each other at run-time.</p>
<p>Design patterns help you define interfaces by identifying their key
elements and the kinds of data that get sent across an interface.  A
design pattern might also tell you what <em>not</em> to put in the
interface.  The Memento  pattern is a good example.
It describes how to encapsulate and save the internal state of an
object so that the object can be restored to that state later. The
pattern stipulates that Memento objects must define two interfaces: a
restricted one that lets clients hold and copy mementos, and a
privileged one that only the original object can use to store and
retrieve state in the memento.</p>
<p>Design patterns also specify relationships between interfaces.  In
particular, they often require some classes to have similar
interfaces, or they place constraints on the interfaces of some
classes.  For example, both Decorator  and
Proxy  require the interfaces of Decorator and Proxy
objects to be identical to the decorated and proxied objects.  In
Visitor , the Visitor interface must reflect all
classes of objects that visitors can visit.</p><h4>Specifying Object Implementations</h4>
<p>So far we've said little about how we actually define an object.  An
object's implementation is defined by its class. The class
specifies the object's internal data and representation and defines
the operations the object can perform.</p>
<p>Our OMT-based notation (summarized in
Appendix&nbsp;B)
depicts a class as a rectangle with the class name in bold.
Operations appear in normal type below the class name.  Any data that
the class defines comes after the operations.  Lines separate the
class name from the operations and the operations from the data:</p><p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/class.gif"></p>
<p>Return types and instance variable types are optional, since we don't
assume a statically typed implementation language.</p>
<p>Objects are created by <strong>instantiating</strong> a class.  The object
is said to be an <strong>instance</strong> of the class.  The process of
instantiating a class allocates storage for the object's internal data
(made up of instance variables) and associates the
operations with these data.  Many similar instances of an object can be
created by instantiating a class.</p>
<p>A dashed arrowhead line indicates a class that instantiates objects
of another class. The arrow points to the class of the instantiated
objects.</p><p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/insta045.gif"></p>
<p>New classes can be defined in terms of existing classes using
class inheritance. When a subclass inherits
from a parent class, it includes the definitions of all
the data and operations that the parent class defines. Objects that
are instances of the subclass will contain all data defined by the
subclass and its parent classes, and they'll be able to perform all
operations defined by this subclass and its parents.  We indicate the
subclass relationship with a vertical line and a triangle:</p><p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/subcl009.gif"></p>

<p>An abstract class is one whose main purpose is to define a
common interface for its subclasses. An abstract class will defer some
or all of its implementation to operations defined in subclasses; hence
an abstract class cannot be instantiated.  The operations that an
abstract class declares but doesn't implement are called
abstract operations.  Classes that aren't abstract are
called concrete classes.</p>
<p>Subclasses can refine and redefine behaviors of their parent classes.
More specifically, a class may override an operation
defined by its parent class. Overriding gives subclasses a chance to
handle requests instead of their parent classes.  Class inheritance
lets you define classes simply by extending other classes, making it
easy to define families of objects having related functionality.</p>
<p>The names of abstract classes appear in slanted type to distinguish
them from concrete classes.  Slanted type is also used to denote
abstract operations.  A diagram may include pseudocode for an
operation's implementation; if so, the code will appear in a dog-eared
box connected by a dashed line to the operation it implements.</p>

<p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/absclass.gif"></p>
<p>A mixin class is a class that's intended to provide an
optional interface or functionality to other classes.  It's similar to
an abstract class in that it's not intended to be instantiated.  Mixin
classes require multiple inheritance:</p><p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/mixin.gif"></p>
<h5>Class versus Interface Inheritance</h5>
<p>It's important to understand the difference between an object's class and its type.</p>
<p>An object's class defines how the object is implemented. The class
defines the object's internal state and the implementation of its
operations.  In contrast, an object's type only refers to its
interface&#151;the set of requests to which it can respond. An object can have
many types, and objects of different classes can have the same type.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a close relationship between class and type.
Because a class defines the operations an object can perform, it also
defines the object's type. When we say that an object is an instance
of a class, we imply that the object supports the interface defined by the
class.</p>



<p>Languages like C++ and Eiffel use classes to specify both an object's
type and its implementation.  Smalltalk programs do not declare the
types of variables; consequently, the compiler does not check that the
types of objects assigned to a variable are subtypes of the variable's
type.  Sending a message requires checking that the class of the
receiver implements the message, but it doesn't require checking that
the receiver is an instance of a particular class.</p>
<p>It's also important to understand the difference between class
inheritance and interface inheritance (or subtyping).  Class
inheritance defines an object's implementation in terms of another
object's implementation. In short, it's a mechanism for code and
representation sharing. In contrast, interface inheritance (or
subtyping) describes when an object can be used in place of another.</p>
<p>It's easy to confuse these two concepts, because many languages don't
make the distinction explicit.  In languages like C++ and Eiffel,
inheritance means both interface and implementation inheritance.  The
standard way to inherit an interface in C++ is to inherit publicly
from a class that has (pure) virtual member functions.  Pure interface
inheritance can be approximated in C++ by inheriting publicly from
pure abstract classes.  Pure implementation or class inheritance can
be approximated with private inheritance.  In Smalltalk, inheritance
means just implementation inheritance. You can assign instances of any
class to a variable as long as those instances support the operation
performed on the value of the variable.</p>
<p>Although most programming languages don't support the distinction
between interface and implementation inheritance, people make the
distinction in practice.  Smalltalk programmers usually act as if
subclasses were subtypes (though there are some well-known
exceptions [Coo92]); C++ programmers manipulate objects through
types defined by abstract classes.</p>
<p>Many of the design patterns depend on this distinction.  For example,
objects in a Chain of Responsibility  must have a
common type, but usually they don't share a common implementation.  In
the Composite  pattern, Component defines a
common interface, but Composite often defines a common implementation.
Command , Observer ,
State , and Strategy  are often
implemented with abstract classes that are pure interfaces.</p><h5>Programming to an Interface, not an Implementation</h5>
<p>Class inheritance is basically just a mechanism for extending an
application's functionality by reusing functionality in parent
classes. It lets you define a new kind of object rapidly in terms of
an old one.  It lets you get new implementations almost for free,
inheriting most of what you need from existing classes.</p>

<p>However, implementation reuse is only half the story. Inheritance's
ability to define families of objects with <em>identical</em> interfaces
(usually by inheriting from an abstract class) is also important. Why?
Because polymorphism depends on it.</p>
<p>When inheritance is used carefully (some will say <em>properly</em>), all
classes derived from an abstract class will share its interface. This
implies that a subclass merely adds or overrides operations and
does not hide operations of the parent class.  <em>All</em> subclasses
can then respond to the requests in the interface of this abstract
class, making them all subtypes of the abstract class.</p> <p>There are two benefits to manipulating objects solely in terms of the
interface defined by abstract classes:</p><ol>
<li>Clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use,
as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expect.</li>



<li>Clients remain unaware of the classes that implement these objects.
Clients only know about the abstract class(es) defining the interface.</li></ol>
<p>This so greatly reduces implementation dependencies between subsystems
that it leads to the following principle of reusable object-oriented
design:</p><blockquote>
<i>Program to an interface, not an implementation.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't declare variables to be instances of particular concrete
classes.  Instead, commit only to an interface defined by an abstract
class. You will find this to be a common theme of the design patterns in
this book.</p>
<p>You have to instantiate concrete classes (that is, specify a
particular implementation) somewhere in your system, of course, and
the creational patterns (Abstract Factory ,
Builder , Factory Method ,
Prototype , and Singleton 
let you do just that.  By abstracting the process of object creation,
these patterns give you different ways to associate an interface with
its implementation transparently at instantiation.  Creational
patterns ensure that your system is written in terms of interfaces,
not implementations.</p><h4>Putting Reuse Mechanisms to Work</h4>
<p>Most people can understand concepts like objects, interfaces, classes,
and inheritance.  The challenge lies in applying them to build
flexible, reusable software, and design patterns can show you how.</p>


<h5>Inheritance versus Composition</h5>
<p>The two most common techniques for reusing functionality in
object-oriented systems are class inheritance and
object composition.  As we've explained, class inheritance
lets you define the implementation of one class in terms of another's.
Reuse by subclassing is often referred to as white-box
reuse. The term "white-box" refers to visibility: With inheritance,
the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.</p>

<p>Object composition is an alternative to class inheritance.  Here, new
functionality is obtained by assembling or <em>composing</em> objects to
get more complex functionality.  Object composition requires that the
objects being composed have well-defined interfaces.  This style of
reuse is called black-box reuse, because no internal
details of objects are visible. Objects appear only as "black
boxes."</p>
<p>Inheritance and composition each have their advantages and disadvantages.
Class inheritance is defined statically at compile-time and is
straightforward to use, since it's supported directly by the
programming language.  Class inheritance also makes it easier to
modify the implementation being reused.  When a subclass overrides
some but not all operations, it can affect the operations it inherits
as well, assuming they call the overridden operations.</p> <p>But class inheritance has some disadvantages, too.  First, you can't
change the implementations inherited from parent classes at run-time,
because inheritance is defined at compile-time.  Second, and generally
worse, parent classes often define at least part of their subclasses'
physical representation. Because inheritance exposes a subclass to
details of its parent's implementation, it's often said that
"inheritance breaks encapsulation" [Sny86]. The
implementation of a subclass becomes so bound up with the
implementation of its parent class that any change in the parent's
implementation will force the subclass to change.</p> <p>Implementation dependencies can cause problems when you're trying to
reuse a subclass. Should any aspect of the inherited implementation
not be appropriate for new problem domains, the parent class must be
rewritten or replaced by something more appropriate.  This dependency
limits flexibility and ultimately reusability. One cure for this is to
inherit only from abstract classes, since they usually provide little
or no implementation.</p>
<p>Object composition is defined dynamically at run-time through objects
acquiring references to other objects.  Composition requires objects
to respect each others' interfaces, which in turn requires carefully
designed interfaces that don't stop you from using one object with
many others. But there is a payoff.  Because objects are accessed
solely through their interfaces, we don't break encapsulation. Any
object can be replaced at run-time by another as long as it has the
same type.  Moreover, because an object's implementation will be
written in terms of object interfaces, there are substantially fewer
implementation dependencies.</p>
<p>Object composition has another effect on system design.  Favoring
object composition over class inheritance helps you keep each class
encapsulated and focused on one task.  Your classes and class
hierarchies will remain small and will be less likely to grow into
unmanageable monsters.  On the other
hand, a design based on object composition will have more objects (if
fewer classes), and the system's behavior will depend on their
interrelationships instead of being defined in one class.</p>
<p>That leads us to our second principle of object-oriented design:</p><blockquote>
<i>Favor object composition over class inheritance.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, you shouldn't have to create new components to achieve reuse.
You should be able to get all the functionality you need just by
assembling existing components through object composition. But this is
rarely the case, because the set of available components is never
quite rich enough in practice.  Reuse by inheritance makes it easier
to make new components that can be composed with old ones.
Inheritance and object composition thus work together.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our experience is that designers overuse inheritance as
a reuse technique, and designs are often made more reusable (and
simpler) by depending more on object composition.  You'll see object
composition applied again and again in the design patterns.</p>
<h5>Delegation</h5>
<p>Delegation is a way of making composition as
powerful for reuse as inheritance [Lie86,
JZ91].  In delegation,
<em>two</em> objects are involved in handling a request: a receiving
object delegates operations to its <strong>delegate</strong>.  This
is analogous to subclasses deferring requests to parent classes.
But with inheritance, an inherited operation can always refer to
the receiving object through the <tt>this</tt> member variable in
C++ and <tt>self</tt> in Smalltalk.  To achieve the same effect
with delegation, the receiver passes itself to the delegate to let
the delegated operation refer to the receiver.</p>
<p>For example, instead of making class Window a subclass of Rectangle
(because windows happen to be rectangular), the Window class might
reuse the behavior of Rectangle by keeping a Rectangle instance
variable and <em>delegating</em> Rectangle-specific behavior to it.  In
other words, instead of a Window <em>being</em> a Rectangle, it would
<em>have</em> a Rectangle.  Window must now forward requests to its
Rectangle instance explicitly, whereas before it would have inherited
those operations.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts the Window class delegating its Area
operation to a Rectangle instance.</p> <p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/deleg063.gif"></p>
<p>A plain arrowhead line indicates that a class keeps a reference to
an instance of another class.  The reference has an optional name,
"rectangle" in this case.</p>
<p>The main advantage of delegation is that it makes it easy to compose
behaviors at run-time and to change the way they're composed.  Our
window can become circular at run-time simply by replacing its
Rectangle instance with a Circle instance, assuming Rectangle and
Circle have the same type.</p>
<p>Delegation has a disadvantage it shares with other techniques that
make software more flexible through object composition: Dynamic,
highly parameterized software is harder to understand than more static
software.  There are also run-time inefficiencies, but the human
inefficiencies are more important in the long run.  Delegation is a
good design choice only when it simplifies more than it complicates.
It isn't easy to give rules that tell you exactly when to use
delegation, because how effective it will be depends on the context
and on how much experience you have with it.  Delegation works best
when it's used in highly stylized ways&#151;that is, in standard
patterns.</p><a name="deleg-patrely">

<p>Several design patterns use delegation.  The
State , Strategy , and
Visitor  patterns depend on it.  In the State
pattern, an object delegates requests to a State object that
represents its current state.  In the Strategy pattern, an object
delegates a specific request to an object that represents a strategy
for carrying out the request.  An object will only have one state, but
it can have many strategies for different requests.  The purpose of
both patterns is to change the behavior of an object by changing the
objects to which it delegates requests.  In Visitor, the operation
that gets performed on each element of an object structure is always
delegated to the Visitor object.</p>
<p>Other patterns use delegation less heavily.
Mediator  introduces an object to mediate
communication between other objects.  Sometimes the Mediator object
implements operations simply by forwarding them to the other objects;
other times it passes along a reference to itself and thus uses true
delegation.  Chain of Responsibility  handles
requests by forwarding them from one object to another along a chain
of objects.  Sometimes this request carries with it a reference to the
original object receiving the request, in which case the pattern is
using delegation.  Bridge  decouples an abstraction
from its implementation.  If the abstraction and a particular
implementation are closely matched, then the abstraction may simply
delegate operations to that implementation.</p>
<p>Delegation is an extreme example of object composition.  It shows that
you can always replace inheritance with object composition as a
mechanism for code reuse.</p>





<h5>Inheritance versus Parameterized Types</h5>
<p>Another (not strictly object-oriented) technique for reusing
functionality is through parameterized types, also known
as <strong>generics</strong> (Ada, Eiffel) and <strong>templates</strong> (C++).
This technique lets you define a type without specifying all the other
types it uses.  The unspecified types are supplied as <em>parameters</em>
at the point of use.  For example, a List class can be parameterized
by the type of elements it contains.  To declare a list of integers,
you supply the type "integer" as a parameter to the List
parameterized type.  To declare a list of String objects, you supply
the "String" type as a parameter.  The language implementation will
create a customized version of the List class template for each type
of element.</p>

<p>Parameterized types give us a third way (in addition to class
inheritance and object composition) to compose behavior in
object-oriented systems.  Many designs can be implemented using any of
these three techniques.  To parameterize a sorting routine by the
operation it uses to compare elements, we could make the comparison</p><ol>
<li>an operation implemented by subclasses (an application of Template Method ,</li>



<li>the responsibility of an object that's passed to the sorting routine
(Strategy , or</li>



<li>an argument of a C++ template or Ada generic that specifies the
name of the function to call to compare the elements.</li></ol>
<p>There are important differences between these techniques.  Object
composition lets you change the behavior being composed at run-time,
but it also requires indirection and can be less efficient.
Inheritance lets you provide default implementations for operations
and lets subclasses override them.  Parameterized types let you change
the types that a class can use.  But neither inheritance nor
parameterized types can change at run-time.  Which approach is best
depends on your design and implementation constraints.</p>
<p>None of the patterns in this book concerns parameterized types, though
we use them on occasion to customize a pattern's C++ implementation.
Parameterized types aren't needed at all in a language like Smalltalk
that doesn't have compile-time type checking.</p><h4>Relating Run-Time and Compile-Time Structures</h4>
<p>An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little
resemblance to its code structure.  The code structure is frozen at
compile-time; it consists of classes in fixed inheritance
relationships.  A program's run-time structure consists of rapidly
changing networks of communicating objects.  In fact, the two
structures are largely independent. Trying to understand one from the
other is like trying to understand the dynamism of living ecosystems
from the static taxonomy of plants and animals, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Consider the distinction between object aggregation and
acquaintance and how differently they manifest themselves
at compile- and run-times.  Aggregation implies that one object owns
or is responsible for another object. Generally we speak of an object
<em>having</em> or being <em>part of</em> another object. Aggregation
implies that an aggregate object and its owner have identical lifetimes.</p>
<p>Acquaintance implies that an object merely <em>knows of</em> another
object.  Sometimes acquaintance is called "association" or the
"using" relationship.  Acquainted objects may request operations of
each other, but they aren't responsible for each other.  Acquaintance
is a weaker relationship than aggregation and suggests much looser
coupling between objects.</p>
<p>In our diagrams, a plain arrowhead line denotes acquaintance.  An
arrowhead line with a diamond at its base denotes aggregation:</p>
<p align=CENTER><img src="Pictures/aggre101.gif"></p>
<p>It's easy to confuse aggregation and acquaintance, because they are
often implemented in the same way. In Smalltalk, all variables are
references to other objects. There's no distinction in the
programming language between aggregation and acquaintance. In C++,
aggregation can be implemented by defining member variables that are
real instances, but it's more common to define them as pointers or
references to instances. Acquaintance is implemented with pointers and
references as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, acquaintance and aggregation are determined more by intent
than by explicit language mechanisms. The distinction may be hard to see
in the compile-time structure, but it's significant.  Aggregation
relationships tend to be fewer and more permanent than acquaintance.
Acquaintances, in contrast, are made and remade more frequently,
sometimes existing only for the duration of an operation.
Acquaintances are more dynamic as well, making them more difficult to
discern in the source code.</p>
<p>With such disparity between a program's run-time and compile-time
structures, it's clear that code won't reveal everything about how a
system will work. The system's run-time structure must be imposed more
by the designer than the language.  The relationships between objects
and their types must be designed with great care, because they
determine how good or bad the run-time structure is.</p>
<p>Many design patterns (in particular those that have object scope)
capture the distinction between compile-time and run-time structures
explicitly.  Composite  and
Decorator  are especially useful for building
complex run-time structures.  Observer  involves
run-time structures that are often hard to understand unless you know
the pattern.  Chain of Responsibility  also results
in communication patterns that inheritance doesn't reveal.  In
general, the run-time structures aren't clear from the code until you
understand the patterns.</p>


<h4>Designing for Change</h4>
<p>The key to maximizing reuse lies in anticipating new requirements and
changes to existing requirements, and in designing your systems so
that they can evolve accordingly.</p>
<p>To design the system so that it's robust to such changes, you must
consider how the system might need to change over its lifetime.  A
design that doesn't take change into account risks major redesign in
the future.  Those changes might involve class redefinition and
reimplementation, client modification, and retesting.  Redesign
affects many parts of the software system, and unanticipated changes
are invariably expensive.</p>
<p>Design patterns help you avoid this by ensuring that a system can
change in specific ways.  Each design pattern lets some aspect of
system structure vary independently of other aspects, thereby making a
system more robust to a particular kind of change.</p>

<p>Here are some common causes of redesign along with the design
pattern(s) that address them:<ol>
<li><em>Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly.</em>
Specifying a class name when you create an object commits you to a
particular implementation instead of a particular interface.  This
commitment can complicate future changes.  To avoid it, create objects
indirectly.
<p>Design patterns:
Abstract Factory ,
Factory Method ,
Prototype .</li>



<li><em>Dependence on specific operations.</em> 
When you specify a particular operation, you commit to one way of
satisfying a request.  By avoiding hard-coded requests, you make it
easier to change the way a request gets satisfied both at
compile-time and at run-time.
<p>Design patterns:
Chain of Responsibility ,
Command .</li>



<li><em>Dependence on hardware and software platform.</em>
External operating system interfaces and application programming
interfaces (APIs) are different on different hardware and software
platforms.  Software that depends on a particular platform will be
harder to port to other platforms.  It may even be difficult to keep
it up to date on its native platform.  It's important therefore to
design your system to limit its platform dependencies.
<p>Design patterns:
Abstract Factory ,
Bridge .</li>



<li><em>Dependence on object representations or implementations.</em>
Clients that know how an object is represented, stored, located, or
implemented might need to be changed when the object changes.  Hiding
this information from clients keeps changes from cascading.
<p>Design patterns:
Abstract Factory ,
Bridge ,
Memento ,
Proxy .</li>



<li><em>Algorithmic dependencies.</em>
Algorithms are often extended, optimized, and replaced during
development and reuse.  Objects that depend on an algorithm will have
to change when the algorithm changes.  Therefore algorithms that are
likely to change should be isolated.
<p>Design patterns:
Builder ,
Iterator ,
Strategy ,
Template Method ,
Visitor .</li>



<li><em>Tight coupling.</em>
Classes that are tightly coupled are hard to reuse in isolation, since
they depend on each other.  Tight coupling leads to monolithic
systems, where you can't change or remove a class without
understanding and changing many other classes.  The system becomes a
dense mass that's hard to learn, port, and maintain.
<p>Loose coupling increases the probability that a class can be reused by
itself and that a system can be learned, ported, modified, and
extended more easily.  Design patterns use techniques such as abstract
coupling and layering to promote loosely coupled systems.</p>
<p>Design patterns:
Abstract Factory ,
Bridge ,
Chain of Responsibility ,
Command ,
Facade ,
Mediator ,
Observer .</li>



<li><em>Extending functionality by subclassing.</em>
Customizing an object by subclassing often isn't easy.  Every new
class has a fixed implementation overhead (initialization,
finalization, etc.). Defining a subclass also requires an in-depth
understanding of the parent class. For example, overriding one
operation might require overriding another.  An overridden operation
might be required to call an inherited operation.  And subclassing can
lead to an explosion of classes, because you might have to introduce
many new subclasses for even a simple extension.
<p>Object composition in general and delegation in particular provide
flexible alternatives to inheritance for combining behavior.  New
functionality can be added to an application by composing existing
objects in new ways rather than by defining new subclasses of existing
classes.  On the other hand, heavy use of object composition can make
designs harder to understand.  Many design patterns produce designs in
which you can introduce customized functionality just by defining one
subclass and composing its instances with existing ones.
<p>Design patterns:
Bridge ,
Chain of Responsibility ,
Composite ,
Decorator ,
Observer ,
Strategy .</li>



<li><em>Inability to alter classes conveniently.</em>
Sometimes you have to modify a class that can't be modified
conveniently.  Perhaps you need the source code and don't have it (as
may be the case with a commercial class library).  Or maybe any change
would require modifying lots of existing subclasses.  Design patterns
offer ways to modify classes in such circumstances.
<p>Design patterns:
Adapter ,
Decorator ,
Visitor .</li></ol>
<p>These examples reflect the flexibility that design patterns can help
you build into your software.  How crucial such flexibility is depends
on the kind of software you're building.  Let's look at the role
design patterns play in the development of three broad classes of
software: application programs, toolkits, and frameworks.</p>
<h5>Application Programs</h5>
<p>If you're building an application program such as a document editor or
spreadsheet, then <em>internal</em> reuse, maintainability, and extension
are high priorities.  Internal reuse ensures that you don't design and
implement any more than you have to.  Design patterns that reduce
dependencies can increase internal reuse.  Looser coupling boosts the
likelihood that one class of object can cooperate with several others.
For example, when you eliminate dependencies on specific operations by
isolating and encapsulating each operation, you make it easier to
reuse an operation in different contexts.  The same thing can happen
when you remove algorithmic and representational dependencies too.</p>
<p>Design patterns also make an application more maintainable when
they're used to limit platform dependencies and to layer a system.
They enhance extensibility by showing you how to extend class
hierarchies and how to exploit object composition.  Reduced coupling
also enhances extensibility.  Extending a class in isolation is easier
if the class doesn't depend on lots of other classes.</p>

<h5>Toolkits</h5>
<p>Often an application will incorporate classes from one or more
libraries of predefined classes called toolkits.  A
toolkit is a set of related and reusable classes designed to provide
useful, general-purpose functionality.  An example of a toolkit is a
set of collection classes for lists, associative tables, stacks, and
the like.  The C++ I/O stream library is another example.  Toolkits
don't impose a particular design on your application; they just
provide functionality that can help your application do its job.  They
let you as an implementer avoid recoding common functionality.
Toolkits emphasize <em>code reuse</em>.  They are the object-oriented
equivalent of subroutine libraries.</p>
<p>Toolkit design is arguably harder than application design, because
toolkits have to work in many applications to be useful.  Moreover,
the toolkit writer isn't in a position to know what those applications
will be or their special needs.  That makes it all the more important
to avoid assumptions and dependencies that can limit the toolkit's
flexibility and consequently its applicability and effectiveness.</p>
<h5>Frameworks</h5>
<p>A framework is a set of cooperating classes that make up a
reusable design for a specific class of
software [Deu89, JF88].  For example,
a framework can be geared toward building graphical editors for
different domains like artistic drawing, music composition, and
mechanical CAD [VL90, Joh92].  Another framework
can help you build compilers for different programming languages and
target machines [JML92].  Yet another might help you build
financial modeling applications [BE93].  You
customize a framework to a particular application by creating
application-specific subclasses of abstract classes from the
framework.</p>
<p>The framework dictates the architecture of your application.  It will
define the overall structure, its partitioning into classes and
objects, the key responsibilities thereof, how the classes and objects
collaborate, and the thread of control.  A framework predefines these
design parameters so that you, the application designer/implementer,
can concentrate on the specifics of your application.  The framework
captures the design decisions that are common to its application
domain.  Frameworks thus emphasize <em>design reuse</em> over code reuse,
though a framework will usually include concrete subclasses you can
put to work immediately.</p>
<p>Reuse on this level leads to an inversion of control between the
application and the software on which it's based.  When you use a
toolkit (or a conventional subroutine library for that matter), you
write the main body of the application and call the code you want to
reuse.  When you use a framework, you reuse the main body and write
the code <em>it</em> calls.  You'll have to write operations with
particular names and calling conventions, but that reduces the design
decisions you have to make.</p> <p>Not only can you build applications faster as a result, but the
applications have similar structures.  They are easier to maintain,
and they seem more consistent to their users.  On the other hand, you
lose some creative freedom, since many design decisions have been made
for you.</p>
<p>If applications are hard to design, and toolkits are harder, then
frameworks are hardest of all.  A framework designer gambles that one
architecture will work for all applications in the domain.  Any
substantive change to the framework's design would reduce its benefits
considerably, since the framework's main contribution to an
application is the architecture it defines.  Therefore it's imperative
to design the framework to be as flexible and extensible as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because applications are so dependent on the framework
for their design, they are particularly sensitive to changes in
framework interfaces.  As a framework evolves, applications have to
evolve with it.  That makes loose coupling all the more important;
otherwise even a minor change to the framework will have major
repercussions.</p>
<p>The design issues just discussed are most critical to framework design.
A framework that addresses them using design patterns is far more
likely to achieve high levels of design and code reuse than one that
doesn't.  Mature frameworks usually incorporate several design
patterns.  The patterns help make the framework's architecture
suitable to many different applications without redesign.</p>

<p>An added benefit comes when the framework is documented with the
design patterns it uses [BJ94].  People who know the
patterns gain insight into the framework faster.  Even people who
don't know the patterns can benefit from the structure they lend to
the framework's documentation.  Enhancing documentation is important
for all types of software, but it's particularly important for
frameworks.  Frameworks often pose a steep learning curve that must be
overcome before they're useful.  While design patterns might not
flatten the learning curve entirely, they can make it less steep by
making key elements of the framework's design more explicit.</p>

<p>Because patterns and frameworks have some similarities, people often
wonder how or even if they differ.  They are different in three major
ways:</p><ol><li><em>Design patterns are more abstract than frameworks.</em> 
Frameworks can be embodied in code, but only <em>examples</em> of
patterns can be embodied in code.  A strength of frameworks is that
they can be written down in programming languages and not only studied
but executed and reused directly.  In contrast, the design patterns in
this book have to be implemented each time they're used.  Design
patterns also explain the intent, trade-offs, and consequences of a
design.</li>



<li><em>Design patterns are smaller architectural elements than
frameworks.</em> A typical framework contains several design patterns, but
the reverse is never true.</li>



<li><em>Design patterns are less specialized than frameworks.</em>  
Frameworks always have a particular application domain.  A graphical
editor framework might be used in a factory simulation, but it won't
be mistaken for a simulation framework.  In contrast, the design
patterns in this catalog can be used in nearly any kind of
application.  While more specialized design patterns than ours are
certainly possible (say, design patterns for distributed systems or
concurrent programming), even these wouldn't dictate an application
architecture like a framework would.</li></ol>
<p>Frameworks are becoming increasingly common and important.  They are
the way that object-oriented systems achieve the most reuse.  Larger
object-oriented applications will end up consisting of layers of
frameworks that cooperate with each other.  Most of the design and
code in the application will come from or be influenced by the
frameworks it uses.</p>
<h3>
How to Select a Design Pattern</h3>
<p>With more than 20 design patterns in the catalog to choose from,
it might be hard to find the one that addresses a particular design
problem, especially if the catalog is new and unfamiliar to you.  Here
are several different approaches to finding the design pattern that's
right for your problem:</p><ol>
<li><em>Consider how design patterns solve design problems.</em>
Section 1.6 discusses how design patterns help
you find appropriate objects, determine object granularity, specify
object interfaces, and several other ways in which design patterns
solve design problems.  Referring to these discussions can help
guide your search for the right pattern.</li>



<li><em>Scan Intent sections.</em> Section 1.4 lists the Intent sections from all
the patterns in the catalog.  Read through each pattern's intent
to find one or more that sound relevant to your problem.  You can
use the classification scheme presented in Table 1.1
to narrow your search.</li>



<li><em>Study how patterns interrelate.</em>
Figure 1.1 shows
relationships between design patterns graphically.  Studying these
relationships can help direct you to the right pattern or group of
patterns.</li>



<li><em>Study patterns of like purpose.</em>
The catalog  has three
chapters, one for creational patterns, another for structural
patterns, and a third for behavioral patterns.  Each chapter starts
off with introductory comments on the patterns and concludes with a
section that compares and contrasts them.  These sections give you
insight into the similarities and differences between patterns of like
purpose.</li>



<li><em>Examine a cause of redesign.</em>
Look at the causes of redesign starting on
 to see if your problem
involves one or more of them.  Then look at the patterns that help you
avoid the causes of redesign.</li>



<li><em>Consider what should be variable in your design.</em> This
approach is the opposite of focusing on the causes of redesign.
Instead of considering what might <em>force</em> a change to a
design, consider what you want to be <em>able</em> to change without
redesign.  The focus here is on <em>encapsulating the concept that
varies</em>, a theme of many design patterns. Table 1.2 lists the design aspect(s) that
design patterns let you vary independently, thereby letting you
change them without redesign.</li></ol>

<h3>
How to Use a Design Pattern</h3>
<p>Once you've picked a design pattern, how do you use it?  Here's a
step-by-step approach to applying a design pattern effectively:</p><ol>
<li><em>Read the pattern once through for an overview.</em>
Pay particular attention to the Applicability and Consequences
sections to ensure the pattern is right for your problem.</li>



<li><em>Go back and study the Structure, Participants, and
Collaborations sections.</em> Make sure you understand the classes and
objects in the pattern and how they relate to one another.</li>



<li><em>Look at the Sample Code section to see a concrete example of the
pattern in code.</em> Studying the code helps you learn how to implement
the pattern.</li>



<li><em>Choose names for pattern participants that are meaningful in the
application context.</em> The names for participants in design patterns
are usually too abstract to appear directly in an application.
Nevertheless, it's useful to incorporate the participant name into the
name that appears in the application.  That helps make the pattern
more explicit in the implementation.  For example, if you use the
Strategy pattern for a text compositing algorithm, then you might have
classes SimpleLayoutStrategy or TeXLayoutStrategy.</li>



<li><em>Define the classes.</em>
Declare their interfaces, establish their inheritance relationships,
and define the instance variables that represent data and object
references. Identify existing classes in your application that
the pattern will affect, and modify them accordingly.</li>



<li><em>Define application-specific names for operations in the pattern.</em>
Here again, the names generally depend on the application.  Use the
responsibilities and collaborations associated with each operation as
a guide.  Also, be consistent in your naming conventions.  For
example, you might use the "Create-" prefix consistently to denote a
factory method.</li>



<li><em>Implement the operations to carry out the
responsibilities and collaborations in the pattern.</em> The
Implementation section offers hints to guide you in the
implementation.  The examples in the Sample Code section can
help as well.</li></ol>
<p>These are just guidelines to get you started.  Over time you'll
develop your own way of working with design patterns.</p>
<p>No discussion of how to use design patterns would be complete without
a few words on how <em>not</em> to use them.  Design patterns should not
be applied indiscriminately.  Often they achieve flexibility and
variability by introducing additional levels of indirection, and that
can complicate a design and/or cost you some performance.  A design
pattern should only be applied when the flexibility it affords is
actually needed.  The Consequences sections are most helpful when
evaluating a pattern's benefits and liabilities.</p>
