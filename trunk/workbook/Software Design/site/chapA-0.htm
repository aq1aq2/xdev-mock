<dl>
<dt>abstract class</dt>
<dd>A class whose primary purpose is to define an
interface.  An abstract class defers some or all of its implementation
to subclasses.  An abstract class cannot be instantiated.</dd>


<dt>abstract coupling</dt>
<dd>Given a class <i>A</i> that maintains a reference
to an abstract class <i>B</i>,  class <i>A</i> is said to be
<em>abstractly coupled</em> to <i>B</i>.  We call this abstract
coupling because <i>A</i> refers to a <em>type</em> of object, not
a concrete object.</dd>


<dt>abstract operation</dt>
<dd>An operation that declares a signature but doesn't
implement it.  In C++, an abstract operation corresponds to a
<b>pure virtual member function</b>.</dd>


<dt>acquaintance relationship</dt>
<dd>A class that refers to another class has an
<em>acquaintance</em> with that class.</dd>


<dt>aggregate object</dt>
<dd>An object that's composed of subobjects.  The
subobjects are called the aggregate's <b>parts</b>, and the aggregate
is responsible for them.</dd>


<dt>aggregation relationship</dt>
<dd>The relationship of an aggregate object to its
parts.  A class defines this relationship for its instances (e.g.,
aggregate objects).</dd>


<dt>black-box reuse</dt>
<dd>A style of reuse based on object composition.
Composed objects reveal no internal details to each other and are
thus analogous to "black boxes."</dd>


<dt>class</dt>
<dd>A class defines an object's interface and
implementation. It specifies the object's internal representation
and defines the operations the object can perform.</dd>


<dt>class diagram</dt>
<dd>A diagram that depicts classes, their internal structure and
operations, and the static relationships between them.</dd>


<dt>class operation</dt>
<dd>An operation targeted to a class and not to an
individual object. In C++, class operations are are called <b>static
member functions</b>.</dd>


<dt>concrete class</dt>
<dd>A class having no abstract operations. It can be
instantiated.</dd>


<dt>constructor</dt>
<dd>In C++, an operation that is automatically invoked
to initialize new instances.</dd>


<dt>coupling</dt>
<dd>The degree to which software components depend on
each other.</dd>


<dt>delegation</dt>
<dd>An implementation mechanism in which an object forwards or <em>delegates</em> a request to another object.  The delegate carries out the
request on behalf of the original object.</dd>


<dt>design pattern</dt>
<dd>A design pattern systematically names, motivates,
and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design
problem in object-oriented systems.  It describes the problem, the
solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences.  It
also gives implementation hints and examples.  The solution is a
general arrangement of objects and classes that solve the problem.
The solution is customized and implemented to solve the problem in
a particular context.</dd>


<dt>destructor</dt>
<dd>In C++, an operation that is automatically invoked to finalize an
object that is about to be deleted.</dd>


<dt>dynamic binding</dt>
<dd>The run-time association of a request to an object
and one of its operations. In C++, only virtual functions are
dynamically bound.</dd>


<dt>encapsulation</dt>
<dd>The result of hiding a representation and
implementation in an object.  The representation is not visible
and cannot be accessed directly from outside the object. Operations
are the only way to access and modify an object's representation.</dd>


<dt>framework</dt>
<dd>A set of cooperating classes that makes up a
reusable design for a specific class of software. A framework
provides architectural guidance by partitioning the design into
abstract classes and defining their responsibilities and collaborations.
A developer customizes the framework to a particular application
by subclassing and composing instances of framework classes.</dd>


<dt>friend class</dt>
<dd>In C++, a class that has the same access rights
to the operations and data of a class as that class itself.</dd>


<dt>inheritance</dt>
<dd>A relationship that defines one entity in terms
of another.  <b>Class inheritance</b> defines a new class in terms
of one or more parent classes.  The new class inherits its interface
and implementation from its parents.  The new class is called a
<b>subclass</b> or (in C++) a <b>derived class</b>.  Class inheritance
combines <b>interface inheritance</b> and <b>implementation
inheritance</b>.  Interface inheritance defines a new interface in
terms of one or more existing interfaces.  Implementation inheritance
defines a new implementation in terms of one or more existing
implementations.</dd>



<dt>instance variable</dt>
<dd>A piece of data that defines part of an object's
representation.  C++ uses the term <b>data member</b>.</dd>


<dt>interaction diagram</dt>
<dd>A diagram that shows the flow of requests between
objects.</dd>


<dt>interface</dt>
<dd>The set of all signatures defined by an object's
operations. The interface describes the set of requests to which
an object can respond.</dd>


<dt>metaclass</dt>
<dd>Classes are objects in Smalltalk.  A metaclass is
the class of a class object.</dd>


<dt>mixin class</dt>
<dd>A class designed to be combined with other classes
through inheritance.  Mixin classes are usually abstract.</dd>


<dt>object</dt>
<dd>A run-time entity that packages both data and the
procedures that operate on that data.</dd>


<dt>object composition</dt>
<dd>Assembling or <em>composing</em> objects to get
more complex behavior.</dd>


<dt>object diagram</dt>
<dd>A diagram that depicts a particular object structure at run-time.</dd>


<dt>object reference</dt>
<dd>A value that identifies another object.</dd>



<dt>operation</dt>
<dd>An object's data can be manipulated only by its operations. An object
performs an operation when it receives a request.  In C++, operations
are called <b>member functions</b>. Smalltalk uses the term
<b>method</b>.</dd>


<dt>overriding</dt>
<dd>Redefining an operation (inherited from a parent class) in a subclass.</dd>


<dt>parameterized type</dt>
<dd>A type that leaves some constituent types unspecified. The
unspecified types are supplied as parameters at the point of use. In
C++, parameterized types are called <b>templates</b>.</dd>


<dt>parent class</dt>
<dd>The class from which another class inherits. Synonyms are
<b>superclass</b> (Smalltalk), <b>base class</b> (C++), and
<b>ancestor class</b>.</dd>


<dt>polymorphism</dt>
<dd>The ability to substitute objects of matching interface for one
another at run-time.</dd>


<dt>private inheritance</dt>
<dd>In C++, a class inherited solely for its implementation.</dd>


<dt>protocol</dt>
<dd>Extends the concept of an interface to include the allowable sequences
of requests.</dd>


<dt>receiver</dt>
<dd>The target object of a request.</dd>


<dt>request</dt>
<dd>An object performs an operation when it receives a corresponding
request from another object.  A common synonym for request is
<b>message</b>.</dd>


<dt>signature</dt>
<dd>An operation's signature defines its name, parameters, and return value.</dd>


<dt>subclass</dt>
<dd>A class that inherits from another class. In C++, a subclass
is called a <b>derived class</b>.</dd>


<dt>subsystem</dt>
<dd>An independent group of classes that collaborate to fulfill a set of
responsibilities.</dd>


<dt>subtype</dt>
<dd>A type is a subtype of another if its interface contains the
interface of the other type.</dd>


<dt>supertype</dt>
<dd>The parent type from which a type inherits.</dd>


<dt>toolkit</dt>
<dd>A collection of classes that provides useful functionality but does not
define the design of an application.</dd>


<dt>type</dt>
<dd>The name of a particular interface.</dd>


<dt>white-box reuse</dt>
<dd>A style of reuse based on class inheritance.  A
subclass reuses the interface and implementation of its parent
class, but it may have access to otherwise private aspects of its
parent.</dd></dl>
