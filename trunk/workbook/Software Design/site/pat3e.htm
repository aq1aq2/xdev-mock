<h2>Singleton</h2>
<h3> Intent</h3><p>Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point
of access to it.</p>
<h3> Motivation</h3><p>It's important for some classes to have exactly one instance.
Although there can be many printers in a system, there should be only
one printer spooler.  There should be only one file system and one
window manager.  A digital filter will have one A/D converter.  An
accounting system will be dedicated to serving one company.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that a class has only one instance and that the
instance is easily accessible?  A global variable makes an object
accessible, but it doesn't keep you from instantiating multiple
objects.</p>
<p>A better solution is to make the class itself responsible for keeping
track of its sole instance.  The class can ensure that no other
instance can be created (by intercepting requests to create new
objects), and it can provide a way to access the instance.  This is
the Singleton pattern.</p>
<h3> Applicability</h3><p>Use the Singleton pattern when</p><ul>
<li>there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be
accessible to clients from a well-known access point.</li>

<li>when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and
clients should be able to use an extended instance without
modifying their code.</li></ul>

<h3>
Participants</h3><ul>
<li><b>Singleton</b></li>


<ul>
<li>defines an Instance operation that lets clients access its
unique instance.  Instance is a class operation (that is, a class
method in Smalltalk and a static member function in C++).</li>
<p><!-- extra space --></p>
<li>may be responsible for creating its own unique instance.</li></ul></ul>
<h3> Collaborations</h3><ul>
<li>Clients access a Singleton instance solely through Singleton's
Instance operation.</li></ul>
<h3> Consequences</h3><p>The Singleton pattern has several benefits:</p><ol>
<li><em>Controlled access to sole instance.</em>
Because the Singleton class encapsulates its sole instance, it can
have strict control over how and when clients access it.</li>

<li><em>Reduced name space.</em>
The Singleton pattern is an improvement over global variables.  It
avoids polluting the name space with global variables that store sole
instances.</li>

<li><em>Permits refinement of operations and representation.</em>
The Singleton class may be subclassed, and it's easy to configure an
application with an instance of this extended class.  You can
configure the application with an instance of the class you need at
run-time.</li>

<li><em>Permits a variable number of instances.</em>
The pattern makes it easy to change your mind and allow more than one
instance of the Singleton class.  Moreover, you can use the same
approach to control the number of instances that the application uses.
Only the operation that grants access to the Singleton instance needs
to change.</li>

<li><em>More flexible than class operations.</em>
Another way to package a singleton's functionality is to use class
operations (that is, static member functions in C++ or class methods
in Smalltalk).  But both of these language techniques make it hard to
change a design to allow more than one instance of a class.  Moreover,
static member functions in C++ are never virtual, so subclasses can't
override them polymorphically.</li></ol>
<h3> Implementation</h3><p>Here are implementation issues to consider when using the Singleton
pattern:</p><ol>
<li><em>Ensuring a unique instance.</em>
The Singleton pattern makes the sole instance a normal instance of a
class, but that class is written so that only one instance can ever be
created.  A common way to do this is to hide the operation that
creates the instance behind a class operation (that is, either a
static member function or a class method) that guarantees only one
instance is created.  This operation has access to the variable that
holds the unique instance, and it ensures the variable is initialized
with the unique instance before returning its value.  This approach
ensures that a singleton is created and initialized before its first
use.
<p>You can define the class operation in C++ with a static member
function <tt>Instance</tt> of the <tt>Singleton</tt> class.
<tt>Singleton</tt> also defines a static member variable
<tt>_instance</tt> that contains a pointer to its unique instance.
<p>The <tt>Singleton</tt> class is declared as<pre>
class Singleton {
public:
    static Singleton* Instance();
protected:
    Singleton();
private:
    static Singleton* _instance;
};
</pre>
<p>The corresponding implementation is</p>
<pre>
Singleton* Singleton::_instance = 0;

Singleton* Singleton::Instance () {
    if (_instance == 0) {
        _instance = new Singleton;
    }
    return _instance;
}
</pre>
<p>Clients access the singleton exclusively through the <tt>Instance</tt>
member function. The variable <tt>_instance</tt> is initialized to 0,
and the static member function <tt>Instance</tt> returns its value,
initializing it with the unique instance if it is 0. <tt>Instance</tt>
uses lazy initialization; the value it returns isn't created and stored
until it's first accessed.</p>
<p>Notice that the constructor is protected.  A client that tries to
instantiate <tt>Singleton</tt> directly will get an error at
compile-time.  This ensures that only one instance can ever get
created.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the <tt>_instance</tt> is a pointer to a Singleton
object, the <tt>Instance</tt> member function can assign a pointer to
a subclass of Singleton to this variable. We'll give an example of
this in the Sample Code.</p>
<p>There's another thing to note about the C++ implementation. It
isn't enough to define the singleton as a global or static object and
then rely on automatic initialization.  There are three reasons for
this:</p><ol>
<li>We can't guarantee that only one instance of a static object
will ever be declared.</li>

<li>We might not have enough information to instantiate every singleton at
static initialization time.  A singleton might require values that are
computed later in the program's execution.</li>

<li>C++ doesn't define the order in which constructors for global objects
are called across translation units [ES90].  This means
that no dependencies can exist between singletons; if any do, then
errors are inevitable.</li></ol>
<p>An added (albeit small) liability of the global/static object approach
is that it forces all singletons to be created whether they are used
or not. Using a static member function avoids all of these problems.</p>
<p>In Smalltalk, the function that returns the unique instance is
implemented as a class method on the Singleton class.  To ensure that
only one instance is created, override the <tt>new</tt> operation.
The resulting Singleton class might have the following two class
methods, where <tt>SoleInstance</tt> is a class variable
that is not used anywhere else:</p>
<pre>
new
    self error: 'cannot create new object'

default
    SoleInstance isNil ifTrue: [SoleInstance := super new].
    ^ SoleInstance
</pre></li>
<li><em>Subclassing the Singleton class.</em>
The main issue is not so much defining the subclass but installing its
unique instance so that clients will be able to use it.  In essence,
the variable that refers to the singleton instance must get
initialized with an instance of the subclass.  The simplest technique
is to determine which singleton you want to use in the Singleton's
<tt>Instance</tt> operation.  An example in the Sample Code shows how
to implement this technique with environment variables.
<p>Another way to choose the subclass of Singleton is to take the
implementation of <tt>Instance</tt> out of the parent class (e.g.,
<tt>MazeFactory</tt>) and put it in the subclass.  That lets a C++
programmer decide the class of singleton at link-time (e.g., by
linking in an object file containing a different implementation) but
keeps it hidden from the clients of the singleton.</p>
<p>The link approach fixes the choice of singleton class at link-time,
which makes it hard to choose the singleton class at run-time. Using
conditional statements to determine the subclass is more flexible, but
it hard-wires the set of possible Singleton classes. Neither approach
is flexible enough in all cases.</p>
<p>A more flexible approach uses a <strong>registry of singletons</strong>.
Instead of having <tt>Instance</tt> define the set of possible
Singleton classes, the Singleton classes can register their singleton
instance by name in a well-known registry.</p>
<p>The registry maps between string names and singletons. When
<tt>Instance</tt> needs a singleton, it consults the registry, asking
for the singleton by name. The registry looks up the corresponding
singleton (if it exists) and returns it. This approach frees
<tt>Instance</tt> from knowing all possible Singleton classes or
instances. All it requires is a common interface for all Singleton
classes that includes operations for the registry:</p>
<pre>
class Singleton {
public:
    static void Register(const char* name, Singleton*);
    static Singleton* Instance();
protected:
    static Singleton* Lookup(const char* name);
private:
    static Singleton* _instance;
    static List&lt;NameSingletonPair>* _registry;
};
</pre>
<p><tt>Register</tt> registers the Singleton instance under the given
name. To keep the registry simple, we'll have it store a list of
<tt>NameSingletonPair</tt> objects. Each <tt>NameSingletonPair</tt>
maps a name to a singleton. The <tt>Lookup</tt> operation finds a
singleton given its name. We'll assume that an environment variable
specifies the name of the singleton desired.</p>
<pre>
Singleton* Singleton::Instance () {
    if (_instance == 0) {
        const char* singletonName = getenv("SINGLETON");
        // user or environment supplies this at startup

        _instance = Lookup(singletonName);
        // Lookup returns 0 if there's no such singleton
    }
    return _instance;
}
</pre>
<p>Where do Singleton classes register themselves? One possibility is in
their constructor. For example, a <tt>MySingleton</tt> subclass could
do the following:</p>
<pre>
MySingleton::MySingleton() {
    // ...
    Singleton::Register("MySingleton", this);
}
</pre>
<p>Of course, the constructor won't get called unless someone
instantiates the class, which echoes the problem the Singleton pattern
is trying to solve!  We can get around this problem in C++ by defining
a static instance of <tt>MySingleton</tt>.  For example, we can
define</p>
<pre>
static MySingleton theSingleton;
</pre>
<p>in the file that contains <tt>MySingleton</tt>'s implementation.</p>
<p>No longer is the Singleton class responsible for creating the
singleton.  Instead, its primary responsibility is to make the
singleton object of choice accessible in the system. The static object
approach still has a potential drawback&#151;namely that instances of all
possible Singleton subclasses must be created, or else they won't get
registered.</p></ol><a name="samplecode"><a>
<h3> Sample Code</h3><p>Suppose we define a <tt>MazeFactory</tt> class for building
mazes as described on .
<tt>MazeFactory</tt> defines an interface for building different
parts of a maze.  Subclasses can redefine the operations to return
instances of specialized product classes, like <tt>BombedWall</tt>
objects instead of plain <tt>Wall</tt> objects.</p>
<p>What's relevant here is that the Maze application needs only one
instance of a maze factory, and that instance should be available to
code that builds any part of the maze.  This is where the Singleton
pattern comes in.  By making the <tt>MazeFactory</tt> a singleton, we
make the maze object globally accessible without resorting to global
variables.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's assume we'll never subclass
<tt>MazeFactory</tt>.  (We'll consider the alternative in a moment.)
We make it a Singleton class in C++ by adding a static
<tt>Instance</tt> operation and a static <tt>_instance</tt> member
to hold the one and only instance.  We must also protect the
constructor to prevent accidental instantiation, which might lead to
more than one instance.</p>
<pre>
class MazeFactory {
public:
    static MazeFactory* Instance();

    // existing interface goes here
protected:
    MazeFactory();
private:
    static MazeFactory* _instance;
};
</pre>
<p>The corresponding implementation is</p>
<pre>
MazeFactory* MazeFactory::_instance = 0;

MazeFactory* MazeFactory::Instance () {
    if (_instance == 0) {
        _instance = new MazeFactory;
    }
    return _instance;
}
</pre>
<p>Now let's consider what happens when there are subclasses of
<tt>MazeFactory</tt>, and the application must decide which one to
use.  We'll select the kind of maze through an environment variable
and add code that instantiates the proper <tt>MazeFactory</tt>
subclass based on the environment variable's value.  The
<tt>Instance</tt> operation is a good place to put this code, because it
already instantiates <tt>MazeFactory</tt>:</p>
<pre>
MazeFactory* MazeFactory::Instance () {
    if (_instance == 0) {
        const char* mazeStyle = getenv("MAZESTYLE");

        if (strcmp(mazeStyle, "bombed") == 0) {
            _instance = new BombedMazeFactory;

        } else if (strcmp(mazeStyle, "enchanted") == 0) {
            _instance = new EnchantedMazeFactory;

        // ... other possible subclasses

        } else {        // default
            _instance = new MazeFactory;
        }
    }
    return _instance;
}
</pre>
<p>Note that <tt>Instance</tt> must be modified whenever you define a
new subclass of <tt>MazeFactory</tt>.  That might not be a problem in
this application, but it might be for abstract factories defined in a
framework.</p>
<p>A possible solution would be to use the registry approach described in
the Implementation section.  Dynamic linking could be useful here as
well&#151;it would keep the application from having to load all the
subclasses that are not used.</p><a name="knownuses"><a>
<h3> Known Uses</h3><p>An example of the Singleton pattern in
Smalltalk-80 [Par90] is the set of changes to the
code, which is <tt>ChangeSet current</tt>.  A more subtle example is
the relationship between classes and their metaclasses.  A
metaclass is the class of a class, and each metaclass has one
instance.  Metaclasses do not have names (except indirectly through
their sole instance), but they keep track of their sole instance and
will not normally create another.</p>
<p>The InterViews user interface toolkit [LCI+92] uses the
Singleton pattern to access the unique instance of its Session and
WidgetKit classes, among others.  Session defines the application's
main event dispatch loop, stores the user's database of stylistic
preferences, and manages connections to one or more physical displays.
WidgetKit is an Abstract Factory  for
defining the look and feel of user interface widgets.  The
<tt>WidgetKit::instance()</tt> operation determines the particular
WidgetKit subclass that's instantiated based on an environment
variable that Session defines.  A similar operation on Session
determines whether monochrome or color displays are supported and
configures the singleton Session instance accordingly.</p>
